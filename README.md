# realtime

I'm public-ing this repository because I'm no longer a student (and I don't want to pay for private repos), and therefore github won't let me have any private repos. You would be an idiot to copy any of it, since it's easily cross-checked against the web, and since *only some of it* works.

I do not give my permission for you to read or use this code *for any purpose* (honor code violation or not) if you are a student in any real-time systems class, but especially one at Virginia Tech, or otherwise taught using ChronOS.

If you're an administrator or Professor Ravindran, please don't revoke my degree. Contact me and I'll get rid of this; I just wanted to keep it safe for my future self to read over in disgust. I'm sorry.
